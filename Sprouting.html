        <h2>The Benefits of Eating Raw Foods</h2>
        <p>Raw foods will create an anti-aging effect, anti degenerative effect because of the enzymes present in it. Sprouted food is
            low in anti-nutrients, high in protein, high in other nutrients, reduces body acidity & inflammation which improves blood 
            sugar management and proper functioning of your body. Therefore raw is king!</p>

            <p>Research has shown that raw foods are far more nutritious than cooked food because higher temperatures destroy the enzymes 
                and nutrients found in food naturally. Any food that is never exposed to temperatures above 115°F (46°C) is considered raw.
                According to research, naturally occurring food contains enzymes that aid in digestion, whereas these same enzymes above 
                118°F are lost, making it difficult to digest. Cooking food not only destroys its enzymes but also destroys that’s vitamins, 
                minerals, and antioxidants. Once these naturally occurring enzymes are destroyed, the body must then utilize its enzymes for 
                digestion by using its own every that takes energy and leaves you feeling sluggish after a meal.</p>

        <p>The process of aging in human beings has been tied to dehydration. Think of the fruit in the sun too long; imagine a slice of apple 
            left outside. That's what dehydration can do to our bodies. Therefore, people who eat primarily raw food feel younger than those who 
            eat mostly cooked and processed foods. Furthermore, natural foods help us balance our body’s PH levels and also alkaline our body. 
            But on the other hand, higher acidic levels and inflammation in the body are the leading dietary causes of diabetes.</p>
        <p>Dietary causes of diabetes are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fat interfering with hormones</li>
            <li>Acidic and inflamed system</li>
            <li>Lack of micro nutrients [vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, antioxidants, nutraceuticals, etc.].</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How to sprout</h2>
        <p>The process of sprouting is easy. The method is the same for nuts, seeds grains and beans the only difference is the germination time
             it will take.You start out by rinsing the food that you’re trying to sprout. Now soak the seeds/grains overnight by placing in a 
             large jar. Make sure the seeds are entirely submerged underwater. I soak my seeds in the sprouter that I made. Link to instructional 
             video on how to make your homemade sprouter is here. You should soak the seeds overnight for at least 10 to 12 hours. Next day, rinse 
             out the seeds in clean water. From now on you don’t need to keep the seeds submerged in water. Every 12 hours try to rinse your seeds 
             in fresh water. I follow a daily routine of doing it at 7 AM and 7 PM. Depending on the seeds or grains you are using you’ll start to 
             see sprouting begin in 2 to 3 days. Continue this process for another day or two until sprouts are at least 1-inch in length. Now you 
             the sprouts are ready. Once sprouting is complete rinse the sprouts with clean water, drain all the water, store in a jar and refrigerate.

        <h2>What to sprout</h2>
        <p>A seed is an embryonic plant covered in a seed coat. Grains, legumes, pulses, and nuts are all types of seeds. Grain is a small edible 
            fruit that is hard on the outside. A legume is a kind of seed in pods, distinctive flowers, and typically root nodules containing symbiotic 
            bacteria able to fix nitrogen. A Pulse is a dried legume which is very high in protein and fiber and low in fat. A nut is a hard-shelled pod 
            that contains both the fruit and seed of the plant. You can soak almost all sorts of seeds mentioned above, but a few won’t sprout. Find below 
            a sprouting chart.</p>
