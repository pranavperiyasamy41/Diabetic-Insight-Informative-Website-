            <h2>Key facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p>The number of people living with diabetes rose from 200 million in 1990 to 830 million
                    in 2022. Prevalence has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than
                    in high-income countries.</p></li>
                <li><p>More than half of people living with diabetes did not take medication for their diabetes
                    in 2022. Diabetes treatment coverage was lowest in low- and middle-income countries.</p></li>
                <li><p>Diabetes causes blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.
                    </p></li>
                <li><p>In 2021, diabetes and kidney disease due to diabetes caused over 2 million deaths. In addition,
                    around 11% of cardiovascular deaths were caused by high blood glucose.</p></li>
                <li><p>A healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco
                    use are ways to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Diabetes can be treated and its consequences avoided or delayed with diet, physical activity, 
                    medication and regular screening and treatment for complications.</p></li>

            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of diabetes may occur suddenly. In type 2 diabetes, the symptoms can be mild and may take many
                 years to be noticed.</p><br>
            <p>Symptoms of diabetes include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>feeling very thirsty.</li>
                <li>needing to urinate more often than usual.</li>
                <li>blurred vision.</li>
                <li>feeling tired.</li>
                <li>losing weight unintentionally.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Over time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys and nerves.<br><br>
                People with diabetes have a higher risk of health problems including heart attack, stroke and kidney failure.<br><br>
                Diabetes can cause permanent vision loss by damaging blood vessels in the eyes.<br><br>
                Many people with diabetes develop problems with their feet from nerve damage and poor blood flow. This can cause 
                foot ulcers and may lead to amputation.</p>

            <h2>Diagnosis and treatment</h2>
            <p>Early diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood glucose. 
                People with type 1 diabetes need insulin injections for survival.<br><br>One of the most 
                important ways to treat diabetes is to keep a healthy lifestyle.Some people with type
                2 diabetes will need to take medicines to help manage their blood sugar levels.<br><br> These can include
                insulin injections or other medicines. Some examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Metformin</li>
                <li>Sulfonylureas</li>
                <li>Thiazolidinediones</li>
                <li>DPP-4 inhibitors</li>
                <li>SGLT2 inhibitors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Along with medicines to lower blood sugar, people with diabetes often need medications to lower 
                their blood pressure and statins to reduce the risk of complications.<br><br>Additional medical 
                care may be needed to treat the effects of diabetes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>foot care to treat ulcers.</li>
                <li>screening and treatment for kidney disease.</li>
                <li>eye exams to screen for retinopathy (which causes blindness).</li>
