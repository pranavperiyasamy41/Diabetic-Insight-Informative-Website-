        <h2>Anti-Gravity resistance exercises</h2>
        <p>Anti-gravity resistance exercises can be performed in the comfort of your home or a hotel room when traveling. You do not need 
            a gym or fancy equipment to perform these exercises. You work against gravity and overcome the resistance imposed by gravity. 
            These exercises will facilitate fat oxidation and glycogen depletion. This is an easy way to cultivate a habit of exercising 
            daily without going to the gym, or it can utilize the extra blood glucose after a heavy meal!

            <li><p>One of the most important benefits is the reduced impact on joints, ligaments, and muscles. This is particularly beneficial for people with arthritis, 
                obesity, or those recovering from orthopedic surgery. By allowing movement with less gravitational force, users can exercise more safely without aggravating pain or injury.
            </p></li>           
            <li><p>Anti-gravity exercises allow patients to begin rehabilitation earlier. For example, a person recovering from ACL surgery can start walking or running much sooner using 
                an anti-gravity treadmill, which decreases the load on the knee. This promotes faster healing and prevents muscle atrophy due to disuse.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>YSince users can engage in cardio activities like walking, jogging, or running with less strain, they can train longer and more consistently. This leads to improved heart 
                health and stamina, even among elderly users or those with cardiovascular conditions.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Anti-gravity resistance systems can still be used for strength training by adjusting resistance levels and increasing repetitions. The added support also encourages better 
                posture, core engagement, and balance, especially for neurological patients such as stroke survivors or those with Parkinson’s disease.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>For many recovering patients or overweight individuals, the fear of falling or pain can be a major psychological barrier. The supportive nature of anti-gravity machines 
                helps them move confidently, which can boost mental health and motivation to continue exercising.
            </p></li>
